# LilyPond One-Offs

LilyPond scores and parts that do not warrant their own project.

Note that none of the scores are anywhere near production-ready. This repository exists mainly for achival purposes.

## Engraving Scores

```shell
make all        # Compiles all scores and parts.
make <file>.pdf # Engraves a single file.
```

See the `/scores` folder for a list of available pieces.

## Installing Fonts

This project uses the [PDQ](https://github.com/Codello/pdq) theme. In order to compile these files the Yorkten font is required.
